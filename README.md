# kusion-module-scaffolding
*This is a quick start template repository for developing a Kusion module, which is built on the [Kusion Module Framework](https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion-module-framework).*

This template repository is intended as a starting point for creating a Kusion Module, containing: 

- An example Kusion Module **kawesome** (`kawesome/`) with both schema definition and generator implementation. It will generate a Kubernetes `Service` and a Terraform `random_password` resource. 

- An example application (`kawesome-example/`) with both developer configuration codes and platform workspace configurations using the kawesome module.
